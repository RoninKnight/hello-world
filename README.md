# hello-world
My First Repository - TEST
RoninKnight here, I'm new to programming.  Looking to learn all the basics starting with SQL and Phyton while exploring Swift for future app developments.
I'm a dedicated individual who is going to be "self taught" via educational resources found on the IOT. 

Any and all help and/or mentors looking for a loyal minon; just feel free to contact me.

Thanks.
